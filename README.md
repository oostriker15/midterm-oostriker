Ontology: For the structure of my website, I wanted it to everything to be clean cut and give off a "prestigious" type feeling, as I felt that this goes along perfectly with the Boston Celtics historic franchise. For this reason I used the famous parquet basketball floor as the background of my homepage, as I felt that the image was a bit breathtaking and gives off the notion of the prestige of the Boston Celtics. Then on my information page, I decided to describe the team's history and logo to build up this prestigious and historic feeling to the team. I then described their most recent success as I felt that it showed off how the team has shown continued success throughout, to avoid feeling as if the team is just an old organization without recent success. I also enjoyed adding it as it described the team that I grew up watching and built my love for the Celtics and basketball as a whole.

Choreography: In terms of the order of which I displayed my content, I felt that showing the famous parquet floor on my home page would transition very well into the first information I included regarding history. I also felt that it was important to first give a background of the team before moving forward. I then went onto talking about the Celtics famous logo, as I felt that it coupled very well with the history for the reader's understanding of the storied success of the franchise. Finally, I decided to describe the most recent championship team next to show off the modern success of the team, which I felt summed up my page very nicely. I believe portraying the information in this order definitely made the most sense.

Z-Pattern: The Z-Pattern is used on my home page, and I believe that it truly creates the perfect arrangement for the page. In the top right corner it says "Learn more about the Boston Celtics" which links to the wiki page for the Celtics for if the reader wants to find more information about the team. In the top left corner, I used a png image of a basketball that fits the background well. In the bottom right it says "Read some Celtics facts!" and is linked to the information page of my site. In the bottom left, I put a statement saying "Most championships. Most Storied Franchise". This phrase I really liked because I felt that it clearly summed up the Celtics stance in the NBA in a way that goes along with the ontology of my site. Overall, I felt that my use of these 4 corners was the best possible to make my page as aesthetically pleasing as possible.

F-Pattern: On my information page, I include an F-Pattern for each section that I included; history, the famous logo, and the new big 3 era. For history, I included an image of the 1956-57 Celtics team. I really liked this image as I felt that it perfectly exemplified an old-fashioned feel that goes well with the history section. For the logo, of course I had to include an image of the Celtics logo which fit perfectly with the section. Finally, for the big 3 era section, it was an easy decision to include a picture of the 3 players that made up the big 3. The first image size fit well on the page, but the next two I had to adjust just a bit.

Crap Principles:
Contrast - I believe that I used contrast very well throughout my page. I made sure that all the colors worked smoothly with one another, and that no words or images seemed out of place or were hard to see. I also made sure to use colors that went along with the Boston Celtics. 

Repition - The principle of repition is exemplified by the F-Patterns that I use on my information page. Each F-Pattern is shown in a similar manner to the last.

Allignment - Allignment is shown by the way that I portrayed all of the different sections on my information page. I made sure that all the images and paragraphs fit well together, and that the page ran smoothly. I also adjusted the image sizes in order to make them fit well into the page. In addition, the allignment that I used for my Z-Pattern I believe made great sense for usability of the page and for aesthetics.

Proximity - In terms of proximity, I made sure that within my F-Patterns it was very clear which images went along with which sections. In addition, the image captions very clearly go along with the rigth images and describe them well.

Fonts: For the body of my site and the "big message" on both pages, I decided to use the Playfair Display font-family. I used this font because I felt that it came off as very simple yet pristine, which goes along perfectly with the Boston Celtics. The Celtics court and jerseys are much more simple than most other teams, yet they give off a prestigious feeling at the same time. This was exactly how I wanted my site to come off as, and I felt that Playfair Display fit perfectly with this. For the rest of the site, I decided to use the Montserrat font-family. I used this because I felt that, much like Playfair Display, it gave off a simple and pristine feeling, but at the same time I felt that it made it interesting to change it up a little bit for the h1 and h2's on my site and also for the stand-alone section. The font complimented Playfair Display well, but made the page a bit more interesting.

CSS Architecture: For my architecture, I first layed out the base for the site. From there, I put together both the layout and modules of my site. Lastly, I put together the state of the site by organizing the Z-Pattern, F-Patterns, etc.
