			<h2>History</h2>

			<div>

				<p>Founded in 1946 as one of the original eight NBA teams to survive the league's first decade, the team is owned by Boston Basketball Partners LLC. The Celtics play their home games at the TD Garden, which they share with the National Hockey League (NHL)'s Boston Bruins.</p>
			
				<p>The franchise is the most successful in NBA history, with 17 championships, which accounts for 23.9 percent of all NBA championships since the league's founding. As a percentage of championships won, the Celtics are currently the most successful franchise in the major four traditional North American professional sports leagues. The Celtics have a notable rivalry with the Los Angeles Lakers, and have played the Lakers a record 12 times in the NBA Finals (including their most recent appearances in 2008 and 2010), of which the Celtics have won 9.</p>

			<h2>The Famous Logo</h2>

			<p>The Boston Celtics logo since the early 1960s features a leprechaun spinning a basketball, named Lucky. It was originally designed by Zang Auerbach, the brother of Celtics head coach Red Auerbach. For a long time, the logo's only colors were black, white and green. Then for the 1996–97 season, celebrating the club's 50th anniversary, the logo got a full-color treatment. Lucky's face and hands were both painted tan, while gold was included on the vest, bow tie and hat, as well as brown on the ball and shillelagh, and black on its pants and shoes. Both the nickname "Celtics" and their mascot "Lucky the Leprechaun" are a nod to Boston's historically large Irish population. The Boston Celtics used to play in the Boston Garden, but in 1995 the TD Banknorth Garden was built, and this is where the Celtics currently play. The floor on the court still very similarly resembles that of the Boston Garden, and the court is known as the parquet. The wood gives off a very elegeant and prestigious feeling to the franchise.</p>

			<h2>The New Big 3 Era</h2>

			<p>In the summer of 2007, GM Danny Ainge made a series of moves that returned the Celtics to prominence. In two blockbuster trades, the Celtics picked up Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett, two perennial All-Stars. These moves created the "Boston Three Party" (the nickname given to describe the combining of Allen, Garnett, and Pierce by Scott Van Pelt in a "This Is Sportscenter" commercial), which would revitalize the team and lead them back to glory. The Celtics completed the largest single-season turnaround in NBA history. The new 'Big Three' of Pierce, Allen and Garnett went 66–16 in the regular season, a 42-game improvement. In the 2008 NBA Finals, the Celtics faced MVP Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers for the 11th time, the first time since 1987. In Game 6, the Celtics overpowered the Lakers, winning 131–92, clinching their 17th NBA title, and first since 1986. It remains the most lopsided win in a championship-clinching game; Paul Pierce was named Finals MVP.</p>
